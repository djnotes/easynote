# Easy Note

__A Simple note keeper for Android__

This is an educational application written as part of an Android development course.
To follow [Modern Android Development][3] guidelines, the database functionality is implemented using [Room][1] that works in combination with
[ViewModel][2] and [ViewBinding][4]. Support for more Jetpack architecture components
and testing might be added in future.
Feel free to send pull requests with your suggested improvements.
